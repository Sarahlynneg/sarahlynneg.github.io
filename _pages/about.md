# Welcome

Welcome to First Christian Church! We’re glad that you’ve found our website, and now that you’re here we hope you’ll take a look around and get to know us a little. Whether you grew up going to church every Sunday, or you are coming back to church after years of being away, or you have never attended church, know that others at First Christian Church have been on similar paths. We don’t all approach life and faith in the same way, but we do our best to welcome one another in the same way that God has graciously welcomed each of us. And we look forward to welcoming you! We gather for worship each Sunday morning at 10:00 am in the sanctuary. That service is also livestreamed and can be accessed each week as it happens or in the video archive. Links are on our homepage. You can be in touch with us by filling out the attendance form or prayer request form on our homepage, using the contact section of this website, or by calling the church office at 812-332-4459.
