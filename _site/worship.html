<h2 id="in-person-and-livestreamed-sunday-morning-worship-at-1000-am">In-Person and Livestreamed Sunday Morning Worship at 10:00 am</h2>

<p>Sunday Morning Worship at FCC is traditional in style and music while progressive in theology. You won’t hear preaching that is harsh or judgmental. The overarching message you will hear is, “God loves you as you are, and there is nothing you can do about it, period, full stop.” The Lord’s Supper or Communion is celebrated weekly during worship. The practice of Holy Communion has become the central element of worship within the Disciples tradition. You will be invited to share in the Lord’s Supper (Holy Communion), where all are welcome. And all means all.</p>

<p>Join us in person in our beautiful sanctuary or you can join us through our livestreamed service. Masks are not required for in person worship. We have masks available for those who do not have a mask, but wish to wear one.</p>

<p>Please visit our extensive archives of FCC sermons and music.</p>

<h2 id="child-care">Child Care</h2>

<p>Child care is available for young children and infants, while older children can listen to a children’s message during the service before going to Children’s Worship.</p>

<h2 id="parking">Parking</h2>

<p>We are located at the corner of Kirkwood and Washington in downtown Bloomington. On Sundays, street parking is free. Guests and visitors are invited to park in designated “FCC” along the east alley of the church. There is also a public parking garage on 7th Street that offers free parking on Sundays. If you need handicap access to the building, you should park near the west side of the building and enter through the doors facing Washington Street.</p>
